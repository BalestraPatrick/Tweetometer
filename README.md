# TweetsCounter

Tweets Counter is an app to see which users are spamming your Twitter timeline. It often happens that I check my timeline and I see a few hundreds of tweets in just a few hours and I wonder "Who is spamming my timeline?". Tweets Counter tries to make it easy to identify these users by counting the number of tweets of each user I follow. 
This project uses [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).

### Usage
Tweets Counter uses CocoaPods to manage the dependencies. If you want to run the projects, makre sure to run `pod install` and open the .xcworkspace.
Please use the latest version of Xcode (7.1 at the moment of writing) and Swift because I'll try to keep the project up to date.
