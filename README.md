# TweetsCounter

Tweets Counter is an app to see which users are spamming your Twitter timeline. It often happens that I check my timeline and I see a few hundreds of tweets in just a few hours and I wonder "Who is spamming my timeline?". Tweets Counter makes it easy to identify these users by counting the number of tweets by each user. New features will be added soon! 

The project is written in Swift 2.0.

### Usage
This project uses [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/) to manage the dependencies. If you want to run the project, you first need to install the pods by doing `pod install`.

Fabric is also used and you need to add your own API key by using [cocoapods keys](https://github.com/orta/cocoapods-keys). First install the gem (if not already installed) and then add your API Key and Build Secret like this:

`pod keys set FABRIC_API_KEY YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`
`pod keys set FABRIC_BUILD_SECRET YOUR_BUILD_SECRET_HERE`

Please use the latest version of Xcode available.

### Contribution
You're welcome to improve and add new features to the app.
