# TweetsCounter

Tweets Counter is an app to see which users are spamming your Twitter timeline. It often happens that I check my timeline and I see a few hundreds of tweets in just a few hours and I wonder "Who is spamming my timeline?". Tweets Counter tries to make it easy to identify these users by counting the number of tweets of each user I follow. 

The project is written in Swift 2.0.

### Usage
This project uses [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/) to manage the dependencies. If you want to run the project, you first need to install the pods by doing `pod install`.
Please use the latest version of Xcode available.

### Contribution
You're welcome to improve and add new features to the app.
