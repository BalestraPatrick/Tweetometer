# How to Contribute

We welcome your contributions to improve the SDKs â€” whether adding new features, creating your own framework that uses Twitter Kit, or fixing bugs you find in the code. We'd love to work with you so that Twitter Kit grows with your needs.

If you have anything you'd like to contribute, we recommend discussing it with the core team before writing it.

## Workflow

The workflow that we support:

1.  Fork twitter-kit-ios
2.  Check out the `master` branch
3.  Make a feature branch
4.  Make your cool new feature or bugfix on your branch
5.  Write a test for your change
6.  From your branch, make a pull request against `twitter/twitter-kit-ios/master`
7.  Work with repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
8.  Wait for your change to be merged internally by staff
9.  Delete your feature branch

## Testing

We've written unit tests in both TwitterKit and TwitterCore. Running them on XCode will perform the needed tests.

## Styleguide

* checkstyle and lint will be used to help enforce code style.

### iOS Style Guide
https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html

See style guide, in particular, when documenting methods:

* Use 3rd person (descriptive) not 2nd person (prescriptive).
* Method descriptions begin with a verb phrase.
* Add description beyond the API name.
* Avoid descriptions that say nothing beyond what you know from reading the method name.


### Git Commit Message Style Guide

* Commit message should describe why the change is being made with a high level overview of significant changes made.

* The first line of commit message should be no more than 65 characters long. This should be a short summary of your commit. Wrap subsequent lines to 80 columns.

* Write commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug"
or "Fixes bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated
by commands like git merge and git revert.

## Code Review

The twitter-kit-ios repository on GitHub is kept in sync with an internal repository at
Twitter. For the most part this process should be transparent to twitter-kit-ios users,
but it does have some implications for how pull requests are merged into the
codebase.

When you submit a pull request on GitHub, it will be reviewed by the
twitter-kit-ios community (both inside and outside of Twitter), and once the changes are
approved, your commits will be brought into the internal system for additional
testing. Once the changes are merged internally, they will be pushed back to
GitHub with the next release.

This process means that the pull request will not be merged in the usual way.
Instead a member of the twitter-kit-ios team will post a message in the pull request
thread when your changes have made their way back to GitHub, and the pull
request will be closed. The changes
in the pull request will be collapsed into a single commit, but the authorship
metadata will be preserved.

Please let us know if you have any questions about this process!
